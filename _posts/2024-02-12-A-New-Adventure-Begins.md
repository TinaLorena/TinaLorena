title: A New Adventure Begins
---

It's never too late for a new adventure!

Nothing but pure **excitement** fills me as I type these words, my first blog via GitHub... okay, well, a little bit nervousness and anxiety too... but that is all always packed together when embarking in new adventures. I am finally fully embracing in my life what I have long championed in others, **CREATIVITY!** 

Today, it's early 2024, and I can't help but wonder what the journey will reveal in five years: What projects will be populating my GitHub account? What new connections will I have developed with interesting people I am yet to meet? what will be simmering in my pot of curiosity?

>“Because of the routines we follow, we often forget that life is an ongoing adventure... Life is pure adventure, and the sooner we realize that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art: to bring all our energies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to notice and admit when what we expected to happen did not happen. We need to remember that we are created creative and can invent new scenarios as frequently as they are needed.”
