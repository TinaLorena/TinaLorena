At this moment, I am currently working on **connecting resources** and **accessing data** for the project proposal described here.


### Project Title

#### Collection: Carmen Dolores Hernández
#### **Word by Word, Four Decades of Literary Passion**


### Background and context

This project centers around the humanist Carmen Dolores Hernández, a prominent Puerto Rican literary critic. She was born in San Juan, PR, on December 14, 1942. Her passion for literature empowered a unique multifaceted career as a researcher, writer, and cultural journalist which includes candid interviews to Puerto Rican and international writers such as Luis Rafael Sánchez, Rosario Ferré, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Isabel Allende. Carmen Dolores Hernández wrote and published book reviews in the newspaper “El Nuevo Día”, almost weekly throughout the span of four decades (1981-2021). Her passion for a good story and respect for the writers is evident in the way she composes her reviews. She leaves the reader with a sense of delight from one book and curiosity about what the next could bring. Her dedication to literature and to serve as a bridge between great contemporary writers and the people of Puerto Rico defined her as an outstanding humanist, earning her the title of Humanist of the Year 2018 bestowed by “Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades”. This recognition has been conferred yearly since 1979 to a Puerto Rican that through work, teachings and activities have made significant contributions to the dissemination of humanistic knowledge throughout the Island.


### Project Objectives

The two main objectives of this project are:

1. Accessibility - to make the book reviews of Carmen Dolores Hernández available to the general public as a tribute to her work, her awarded recognition as a Puerto Rican humanist, and as a window to a vast literary world studied over the course of four decades. Currently, they are not accessible to the public and are only accessible to subscribers of El Nuevo Dia. Using the search tool in the site does not result in a complete collection, the few that result are not connected in any way other than by the search keywords. Keywords like “reseña” or even “Carmen Dolores Hernández” only return at most 10 book reviews. 

2. Discovery - to create a digital navigation experience that breaks away from the linearity and rigid structures of timelines and digital archives. Readers can engage in a fluid way driven by curiosity and the multiplicity of intrinsic connections between books and their reviews by Hernández. 
* Connections – One of the design challenges will be to define the types of connections the interphase will highlight. Some potential categories are: topics, use of words in reviews, book genre, authors’ nationality, level of recommendation (critical review), writing style elements present in books, etc. A more personal connection that could be explored is Hernández life events and how they braid emotionally with her work and the emotional connections to the books.
* Interphase navigation – This project will try to depart from traditional forms of archives and repository websites. Two inspirational projects that have tried this are from Fathom Information Design:
  + [On Being](https://discover.fathom.info/episodes/alain-de-botton-the-true-hard-work-of-love-and-relationships-aug2018/)
  + [Ron Carter Universe](https://www.roncarteruniverse.com/r/7)

This project aims to enrich the culture of Puerto Ricans by giving access to the works of one of its renowned humanists. It also seeks to become an invitation to the local and global community to use information in innovative ways while fostering data trust and literacy. Our world is becoming one where data is one more language of communication, the sooner we polish our skills, the better we will be prepared to contribute skillfully with the rest of the world.
